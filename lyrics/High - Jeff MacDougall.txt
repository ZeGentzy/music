Safe in the capsule,
gonna leave here
so~on.

Nothing around me,
though there's not much
ro~om.

It's quiet, it's cold.
Can you hear me?
It's Tom.

I'm High~ (High~, High~, High~, High~)
Can you see me?
I'm the blink in the night sky.
Not afraid.
So much to fear.
Hey, I can see
my house from here.

Nowhere to speak of,
and still my head
is on the door.
I gave it a shove,
and I'm out
into the clear.
Don't wanna take
a fall
from here.

Out of the capsule,
gonna leave here
so~on.

And the stars, are very different today.
And I'm floating, in the most peculiar way.

I'm High~ (High~, High~, High~, High~)
Can you see me?
I'm the blink in the night sky.
Not afraid.
Everything's clear.
There's nothing left,
to engineer.

I'm High~ (High~, High~, High~, High~)
Can you see me?
I'm the blink in the night sky.
Not afraid.
Everything`s clear.
Tell my wife,
that weeps for tears.
