Long ago when we were younger,
And in love,
We take the long way home.
You bike my baseball glove,
And when we get there,
we climb up on the roof.
Look up at the clouds 
And see what shape they took.

Now it's been years.
And your miles and miles away.
And when the nights are clear.
I get up on the roof like all those afternoons.
And look up at the Moon.

Last I saw you, you were getting on the train.
Kinda cloudy, it felt like it might rain
Said goodbye like you were going for a day
I tried to write you, but I don't know how to say,

That I'm standing here.
And your miles and miles away.
And when the nights are clear.
I climb up on the roof like all those afternoons.
And look up at the Moon.

And you used to say, 
That everyone who's faraway 
Is closer than you think.
That we all are in sync.
Just go outside,
And look up at the Moon,
And whistle the same toon.

Now it's been years.
And your miles and miles away.
And when the nights are clear.
I get up on the roof like all those afternoons.
And look up at the Moon.
I look up at the Moon.
